The Shop 

Client code (Program.cs) orders and sells items and also displays those that he has been able to find and those that he hasn't been able to find in the Shop.

When ordering an article, Shop needs to find the article amongst the given suppliers (It can be any external service) where they have it in stock 
and where the price is not more expensive than the maximum price a client is ready to pay for.
